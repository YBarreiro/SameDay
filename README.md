# SameDay-Diary

**Description**  
SameDay is a desktop application designed to help users maintain a personal diary. Its main feature allows users to view all entries of the current day across previous years. For example, opening the app on June 5th, 2025, will display entries written on June 5th of 2024, 2023, and so on â€” hence the slogan: *One day, many years*.
